Terms of Services:

I called here packages (Web Design, SEO, DATA Entry, Graphics Design etc) as projects. I work with three different propositions from which you choose (based on one, or mixed like: "I like colours from first and font from third") 3 further consultations (I mean: I'm doing work based on your suggestions show where it takes us and try to figure out what else is to change) I limit the number of consultation to avoid endless conversation like: "can you design new website layout with different logo? No change my mind, second last was perfect, no no on the beginning was perfect" I take 1/3 price in advance for any of your project. So you pay me 1/3 price and I start to work, after you seeing my propositions you decide that you want to work with me, or not. If not, I keep cash. This prevents me for working for free, and you for paying whole amount for something that you don't like. If you decide to work with me further I will be giving you prpogress reports, updates and consultations that we agreed. After finished work you paying me rest of money, and after that I'm sending you full packet of website, forums, logo or your required data. That's includes different formates, jpg, psd, xls,docs, pdf .php, html files etc. Generally I'll give you zip file which you can send to anybody (like printshop, web designer etc) and they will have what they need, so you'll no worry for questions like "can you send me again your logo but this time in pdf formate. If you decide to pay me all amount in advance I'll give you 10% discount.
